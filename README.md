# Icons and tiles generator
This is a set of files to make it easy to generate bitmaps for tiles and icons in different resolutions for your applications.
The input is well documented SVG-files made in Inkscape and with a script (also well documented) PNG-files are generated. 
To use this, you need:

*	[Inkscape] (https://inkscape.org/en/)
*	[Inkscape batch GUI] (http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/InkscapeBatch.shtml). Linked to Softpedia. Previously this was available on [http://inkscapebatch.org/] (http://inkscapebatch.org/) but now the link is broken.


## How to use it
To generate bitmaps, you should in short do the following:

*	Edit the SVG-files.
*	Open the script in Inkscape batch GUI and Press Start batch converter in Inkscape batch and wait a few seconds.
*	Copy the bitmaps to your project.

There is some extra documentation for each platform. Read this! :-)

## Supported platforms
Currently only Universal Windows Platform (Windows 10) is supported, but itâ€™s should be very, very easy to port this to other platforms.
