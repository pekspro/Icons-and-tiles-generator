# Icons and tiles generator
This is a set of files to make it easy to generate bitmaps for tiles and icons in different resolutions for your applications. Currently only Universal Windows Platform (Windows 10) is supported, but it’s should be very, very easy to port this to other platforms.
The input is well documented SVG-files made in Inkscape and with a script (also well documented) PNG-files are generated. 
To use this, you need:

*	[Inkscape] (https://inkscape.org/en/)
*	[Inkscape batch GUI] (http://inkscapebatch.org/)


## How to use it
To generate bitmaps, you should in short do the following:

*	Edit the SVG-files
*	Open the script in Inscape batch GUI and Press Start batch converter in Inkscape batch and wait a few seconds.
*	Copy the bitmaps to your project.

There is some extra documentation for each platform. Read this! :-)
